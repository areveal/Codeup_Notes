### more file stuff ###

`__FILE__` shows what file you are working with and `__DIR__` shows what directory you are working in.

`is_readable();`check to see if the file is readable and if it exists.

`feof();` check to see if the pointer is at the end of the file. 

`fopen($filename, 'w');` opens file for write, truncates the file.

`fopen($filename, 'a');` opens file for write, appends to the current file.

`fopen($filename, 'c');` opens file for write, appends to the beginning of the file.
