### If Else
**Only difference:** `else if` must have space in between words. Will not read correctly otherwise.

Good practice to declare varaibles outside the if statement and set inside. i.e.
```
var msg;

if (....) {
	msg = "....";
}
```
###Switch
Exact same as PHP.
###While / Do While
Exact same as PHP.
###For
Exact same as PHP.

###User Interaction
* `prompt()` - prompts the user for text.
* `confirm()` - opens up a confirm dialogue box.
* `alert()` - alert's the user with a dialogue box.
