###Sorting Functions

`sort();` - sorts array normally.
`rsort();` - sorts array in reverse.
`asort();` - sorts array and keeps indexes/keys with its values.
`ksort();` - sorts array by keys.

**REMEMBER**
---
If you call on the value of a sort it reurns a **BOOLEAN**!! You must sort **and then** store!!
